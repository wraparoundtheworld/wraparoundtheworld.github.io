# My Wedding Website

Welcome to the repository for my wedding website! This repository is a fork of the [React95/nextjs-template](https://github.com/React95/nextjs-template), which provides a solid foundation for building React-based websites using Next.js with a nostalgic Windows 95 look and feel. I have customized the template specifically for my wedding, incorporating features and content relevant to the event.

## Introduction
This website is dedicated to sharing information and updates about my wedding. I created this website to provide an easy and accessible way for my friends, family, and guests to stay informed about the wedding ceremony, reception, and other related events.
